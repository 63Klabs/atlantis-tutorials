By the end of this tutorial you will be able to identify the various stages of the CodePipeline build and deployment process, and utilize automated scripts during the build.

1. Seed repository and create pipeline
2. Inspect the Pipeline progress through the console
3. Review CodeBuild logs in the console
4. Review buildspec.yml and identify the phases
5. Create a simple script to run during CodeBuild
6. Build packages vs Application packages
